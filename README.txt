I had to visually butcher a couple of things to extract some plugins I was reliant on

The code (Blueprint isn't great), and the majority for the grinding is in the Blueprint (SplineBP). I have a massive distaste for visual programming coming back to this after 3 years so I apologise here for the mess

Email alexspedding271(at)gmail.com with start of subject as "99th Street" if you have any questions, I reserve the right to not respond because I probably have as much of a clue as you about what is going on
